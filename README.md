# Unit 2: Performance Assessment [SE12 ‘25-26]

## Intro

This performance assessment will evaluate your ability to **plan, design, and implement a chatbot** that leverages APIs to provide services to users. You will demonstrate your knowledge of **functions, HTTP requests, asynchronous programming, and API integration**.

---

## Requirements

You will build **2 simple command-line chat bots**:

1. **`chatgpt.js`** – the user can ask ChatGPT a question using the ChatGPT API.
2. **`api.js`** – the user will call a **brand-new API** (one we have NOT used in class) and display the results.
